## Aavegotchi auto borrower

It is for me a good exercise to get more familiar with web3 dev environment and mechanics.

Any comment, remark or suggestions would be highly appreciated.

## Main actions

The purpose of the bot is to borrow a certain number of gotchis with some parameters wanted.

You can set parameters for : 
- the lending duration
- the ghst upfront cost
- the borrower share for you
- if the gotchi to borrow should have channel ready
- minimum kinship needed 
- number of gotchis you want to borrow

It will automatically borrow the gotchi that is below your ghst limit and have the more % of share for you.

It will then iterate until all borrow are fulfill from your parameters.

## How it works ##

A configuration file take all the informations needed and use them across the routine to perform the borrow sequence

Routine is run based on a 7 sec period.

## Prerequisites

* Already agreed ghst spending for the wallet used (go to the lending page of any gotchi directly on the aavegotchi website and see if you can borrow directly or if it tell you to agree ghst spending first)
* [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) account (free for this usage)
* (pm2 if wanted)


## IMPORTANT ##
Please don't hesitate to ask if you're not sure about a specific part of the code before starting it.

### 1. Clone the repo

//private key (until I find something better ...)
```

### 4. How to run the bot
```bash
node main https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<replace-with-your-cred>
```

### 5. How to run the bot (alternative)

Alternatively you can use the [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) command to run your bot on background and managing it a little bit better.

You can add the `--no-autorestart` to `pm2` command in order to only execute the bot once.

```bash
pm2 start main.js --no-autorestart -- https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<replace-with-your-cred> 
```

### 6. Example

`node main https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<replace-with-your-cred>`
```bash
